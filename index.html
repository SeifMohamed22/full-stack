            On 25 October 2011, torrential rain caused floods and mudslides in Cinque Terre. Nine people were killed and
            villages were severely damaged, particularly Vernazza and Monterosso al Mare.[3] The heavy rainfall event
            was favoured by the crisis of the traditional and less remunerative cultivation of terraced landscapes which
            sixty years before started a progressive decline and reduction of maintenance. It was partially balanced by
            the vegetation that spontaneously developed on abandoned terraces, a role underlined by a part of the
            existing scientific literature.[4]

            The convent of Monterosso al Mare. The convent is visible from all parts of the Cinque Terre and is a prime
            attraction for tourists, thanks to its historical and artistic treasures. They are reminiscent of the 1600
            building in Capuchin style, with the altar and choir in wood. Among its works of art is a "Crucifixion",
            attributed to Van Dyck and "Saint Girolamo the penitent" by Luca Cambiaso. The refectory with its vaulted
            ceiling features Strozziâ€™s "Veronica". The convent has maintained the characteristics typical of the time of
            its origins, in addition to the sublime view invites contemplation.

          <p class="box-paragrah">
            In the 15th century, Vernazza focused its defence against the dreadful and regularly occurring pirate raids,
            erecting a fortifying wall. In the mid-17th century, like many of the Cinque Terre villages, Vernazza
            suffered a period of decline that negatively affected wine production, and prolonged the construction of the
            trail system and harbour molo (mole constructed to protect against heavy seas).

            In the days before December 8, 2022, the date on which the Nativity scene was lit, Andreoli had requested
            that the fireworks be made, an event not foreseen in recent years. On 22 December 2022, Andreoli died at the
            age of 94. His work in the creation of the crib, its preparation and conservation will be managed and
            preserved by the association that takes his name, established on November 2, 2017

            However, it is possible that the name Romulus was actually derived from Rome itself.[21] As early as the 4th
            century, there have been alternative theories proposed on the origin of the name Roma. Several hypotheses
            have been advanced focusing on its linguistic roots which however remain uncertain:[22]
